/*creating a random number generator to create individual roll values 
based on the values of each die type used and the total number of dice used

thoughts: going to want to use math.floor and math.random

vision: create dropdown for die type: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
have +/- (and clear button to delete all) and number to display current 
value at the top to request more or less dice, append dropdowns with 
die values/remove dropdowns*/
